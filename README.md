# Germany Daily Electricity Consumption Analysis in R Programming
This project analyzes daily electricity consumption in Germany from the provided dataset (opsd_germany_daily.csv). The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, and statistical modeling.
## Overview
This project analyzes daily electricity consumption data in Germany from 2006 to 2018. The dataset includes information on electricity consumption, solar energy production, and wind energy production, enabling a comprehensive analysis of energy trends over time.

## Dataset
The primary dataset used in this analysis is the `opsd_germany_daily.csv`, which contains daily records of:
- **Consumption**: Total electricity consumption (GWh)
- **Solar**: Daily solar energy production (GWh)
- **Wind**: Daily wind energy production (GWh)

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns in electricity consumption.
- Visualize electricity consumption alongside solar and wind energy production.
- Generate summary statistics and insights from the data.

## Technologies Used
- R Programming Language
- ggplot2 for data visualization
- dplyr for data manipulation
- zoo for calculating rolling averages
